# vento
`Vento` is an Asset(Hardware and Software) Inventory Management system where all the assets can be managed with ease by the Lab Owners.

# Code
Code is distributed into three main directories:

- `client`: The client side is a [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) based web app project. It can be hosted locally in development mode. The build script helps to build the production artficats of the UI Project.
- `rest-services`: The User Interface(client) interacts with the back-end data-store over Rest Services. Rest services are built using [SailsJs](https://sailsjs.com/).
- `database`: It uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as data-store. Minimum supported version is 11.0.
